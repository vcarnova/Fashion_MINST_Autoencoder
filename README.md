Fashion Minst Autoencoder


I built a convolutional autoencoder to compress the FashionMNIST dataset. 

>The encoder portion will be made of convolutional and pooling layers and the decoder will be made of **transpose convolutional layers** that learn to "upsample" a compressed representation.


### Compressed Representation

A compressed representation can be great for saving and sharing any kind of data in a way that is more efficient than storing raw data. In practice, the compressed representation often holds key information about an input image and we can use it for denoising images or oher kinds of reconstruction and transformation!
